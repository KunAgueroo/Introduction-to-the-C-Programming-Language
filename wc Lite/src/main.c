  // parsing.
  //   Some of these you may discover/invent as you go, but it is clear you will
  //   need:
  //   - Some way of storing which of the -c, -w, -n, and -l flags are active
  //   - The width to use when printing file names (affected by the -f flag)
  //   - The output file
  // You should give a default value for each variable.  Note that for an output
  // FILE *, a default value of stdout is perfectly fine.  Concerning the flags,
  // the default should be something that means "false".  You will need, in the
  // next step, to keep track of whether any of the flags are set explicitly on
  // the command line, so you'll need an extra variable for that, e.g., any_set.

  // TODO 2) Write a suitable loop here that repeatedly calls getopt until the
  //   results is -1.  The body of the loop should switch on the flag found, and
  //   have a case for each of the command line flags.  Each case may save a
  //   value, do some action, or a combination of both.  Adjust any_set as
  //   needed. After the loop, use any_set to determine whether to set the
  //   default overall flag configuration.  (This can't be done before the
  //   getopt loop because you don't know yet whether any flags were given on

  // TODO 4) Write a suitable loop that will process each file.  Note that
  //   optind will give the index in argc of the first file name.
  //   For each file name:
  //     - Try to open the file for reading.  If that fails, print the required
  //       message and go on to the next iteration of the loop.
  //     - Set the within-file counters to zero.
  //     - Loop, reading each line of the file with getline.
  //       - You can immediately adjust your within-file character and line
  //         counts; the number of characters read is the result that getline
  //         returns :-) .
  //       - Use a suitable loop to count words (groups of non-delimiters
  //         actually), by alternating calls to strcpsn and strspn.  (Read
  //         the slides for this module, and see the example below!)
  //       - Use a suitable loop to count numbers by similarly alternating calls
  //         to strspn and strcspn.  The two loops will have some differences.
  //     - Output a line with this file's information.  We found it handy to
  //       write an output_line function, passing the file name, counts, and
  //       flag values.
  //     - Add the per-file counts into the running totals.
  //     - Close the input file
  //
  // Example loop using strspn and strcspn.  This code will count the number
  // of runs of the letter 'x' in a string.  (A "run" is a sequence of one or
  // more of the same letter.)
  //   char *s = ... the string to be searched ...
  //   int xruns = 0;
  //   char *p = s;
  //   for (char *p = s; *p != 0; /* nothing */) {  // stops at end of string
  //      p += strcpsn(p, "x");  // bumps p to skip non-x characters
  //      int nx = strspn(p, "x");
  //      p += nx;
  //      xruns += (nx != 0);  // adds a 0/1 value to xruns
  //   }
  // Make sure you understand this loop before coding your own!
  // Certainly there are amny variations that will act the same;
  // The above is one of the most concise, and exploits a number
  // of C coding techniques.
  //
  // The count-numbers loop will be very similar to the above.
  // The count-words loop will be more different because you'll use
  // the set of delimiters as the second argument to strspn/strcspn,
  // but you want to count the runs of NON-delimiters, not of delimiters.
